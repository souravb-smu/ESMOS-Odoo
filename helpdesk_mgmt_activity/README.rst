Use Cases / Context
===================

To streamline your helpdesk operations you can set activities to the pre-configured odoo modules records right from the Helpdesk. 

The ticket will be moved to the pre-defined stage when the activity is marked as done.

For instance:

A customer reaches the support team regarding a delayed shipment. 
- Assign Activity: The helpdesk support team user opens a ticket for the relevant Inventory picking record with specific instructions to check the shipment status and actions that must be taken.
- Warehouse Action: The assigned warehouse user sees the new activity in their Odoo dashboard, follows the prescribed steps to investigate, and updates the activity status accordingly.
- Automated Updates: Once the warehouse user marks the activity as done, the ticket automatically moves to the "Awaiting" stage to be checked by the support team user.

Configuration
=============
