This module adds advanced ticket assignment methods to Odoo Helpdesk
teams. You can configure each team to assign tickets manually, randomly,
balanced (least open tickets), or sequentially (round-robin). Automatic
assignment only works if users are assigned to the team. The responsible
user is set automatically when creating or updating tickets, improving
workflow and team efficiency.

Usage
=====

1. Go to *Helpdesk > Teams* and select or create a team.
2. In the team form, choose the **Assignment Method**: Manual, Randomly,
   Balanced, or Sequential.
3. Add users to the team (required for automatic assignment).
4. Save the team.

When creating a new ticket (from Kanban or form view):

- Select the team for the ticket.

- The responsible user will be automatically assigned based on the
  team's assignment method:

  - **Manual**: No automatic assignment; you must select the user
    manually.
  - **Randomly**: The ticket is assigned to a team member in a fair
    random order.
  - **Balanced**: The ticket is assigned to the user with the fewest
    open tickets.
  - **Sequential**: The ticket is assigned in round-robin order among
    team members.

Note: - If no users are assigned to the team, only the manual method is
available. - Changing the team on a ticket will re-trigger the
assignment logic.
