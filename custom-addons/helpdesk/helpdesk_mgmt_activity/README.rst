Use Cases / Context
===================

To streamline your helpdesk operations you can set activities to the
pre-configured odoo modules records right from the Helpdesk.

The ticket will be moved to the pre-defined stage when the activity is
marked as done.

For instance:

A customer reaches the support team regarding a delayed shipment.  -
Assign Activity: The helpdesk support team user opens a ticket for the
relevant Inventory picking record with specific instructions to check
the shipment status and actions that must be taken. - Warehouse Action:
The assigned warehouse user sees the new activity in their Odoo
dashboard, follows the prescribed steps to investigate, and updates the
activity status accordingly. - Automated Updates: Once the warehouse
user marks the activity as done, the ticket automatically moves to the
"Awaiting" stage to be checked by the support team user.
