1.  Go to *Helpdesk \> Teams* and select or create a team.
2.  In the team form, choose the **Assignment Method**: Manual,
    Randomly, Balanced, or Sequential.
3.  Add users to the team (required for automatic assignment).
4.  Save the team.

When creating a new ticket (from Kanban or form view):

- Select the team for the ticket.

- The responsible user will be automatically assigned based on the team's assignment method:  
  - **Manual**: No automatic assignment; you must select the user
    manually.
  - **Randomly**: The ticket is assigned to a team member in a fair
    random order.
  - **Balanced**: The ticket is assigned to the user with the fewest
    open tickets.
  - **Sequential**: The ticket is assigned in round-robin order among
    team members.

Note: - If no users are assigned to the team, only the manual method is
available. - Changing the team on a ticket will re-trigger the
assignment logic.
